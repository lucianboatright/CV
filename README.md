I have moved into the tech world with a passion and history of problem solving and creation. I have gained my experience from a wide range of
platforms from Material science, Product and Furniture design to electric bike mechanics. This has expanded my capabilities while fostering
my insatiable curiosity to learn new ideas and grow.

Since Febuary 2019 I have been working with Programing languages, I started with Python and created two programs, a Running and a Cycling
version that mapped interesting states. From December 2019 I have been with Makers and have recently graduated. This had been a great
experience and also taught me a lot about pair programing excited me as there is a lot to feed my curiosity

 I am a keen problem solver with experience in a wide range of areas from Mechanics to materials. I am a very active person with passion and exctiment for what I do.

## Skills

<!-- Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.


From years of experience solving problems and working with teams and customers I have a high level of comunicative skills. 
Due to many industry jobs I have also learned to work well in teams and leadig teams. This was refined at Univercity Design course and throughout my workig carrea. I am good at aporaching to problems from multiple angles and seeing things in many different ways which has both been very usefull in programing and very intersting as there are some many different wasys to compleat teh same task in codeing. -->

Planning and Organising
Through out makers and the past year I have developed many techniques for mapping out growth that has both happened and will happen. This had
been through planing out weeks, months and longer. I allow for flexibility as plans do change but I prefer to have a plan than not. This is
followed by the daily reflections that review work done and ways to improve efficiency and enjoyment. 

Team Building and Passion
At makers I had the opportunity to show my love for teams and working with people by organizing and facilitating a Team Building Workshop. This was based on the Marsh-mellow Tower Challenge and progressed into the Bridge Building project. Although I have the ability to facilitate groups I also enjoy listening to people, the saying two head are better than one and more the merrier open me up to other peoples ideas, stories and passions. 


Research and Development
Two of my favorite words. Research is a skill and passion I have developed from an insatiable curiosity and an inspiration driven love. Development is the fun part where the hard work from research starts to form itself and grow.

 From the mixed background and insatiable curiosity I have a great ability to generate ideas and
