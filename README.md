I am a programmer with a passion for problem solving and a History for creating innovative solutions. I have gained my experience in a wide range of areas from material science, product and furniture design to electric bike mechanics. This has expanded my capabilities while fostering an insatiable curiosity to learn new ideas and grow. 

<!-- I have been programing for over a year with experience in several languages, frameworks and testing listed below. This has been combined with my ability to interact with teams and individuals as shown in my positions in previous jobs. Makers had added to this by giving me experience in coding best practices and experience in Agile and XP adding to my previous team skills.

Since Febuary 2019 I have been working with Programing languages, I started with Python and created two programs, a Running and a Cycling
version that mapped interesting states. From December 2019 I have been with Makers and have recently graduated. This had been a great
experience and also taught me a lot about pair programing excited me as there is a lot to feed my curiosity -->

## Skills
##### Technologies 
I have experience in the listed languages but have the ability to pick up new languages quickly from a refined process of reflective learning. As a developer I understand many of the core tenants of good programing such as TDD, OOP and DDD and have an understanding of many principle frameworks like the MVC and OAuth2. 

Programing Languages and Frameworks
Ruby - Ruby-Rails - Python - Java-script - Node.js - React.js - Jquery - CSS - HTML 
Test Languages 
Rspec - Capybara - Jest - Cypress - Sinatra - experience building test framework for Java-script 


<!-- ##### Planning and Organising
Throughout makers and the past year I have developed many techniques for mapping out growth that has both happened and will happen. This had been through planing out weeks, months and longer. I allow for flexibility as plans do change but I prefer to have a plan than not. This is followed by the daily reflections that review work done and ways to improve efficiency and enjoyment.  -->

##### Team Building and Passion
I have had show my love for teams and working with people by organizing and facilitating a team building workshops. Although I have the ability to facilitate groups I also enjoy listening to people in order to help the team grow and the project to have the best possible input from each member. This has been shown by my promotions as head ride leader at Rapha and as head mechanic at Vanmoof. Though I have also shown independence when I was running the curiosity's at Paul Smith or as an independent Designer.

##### Research and Development
Research is a skill and passion I have developed from an insatiable curiosity and an inspiration driven love, it allows me to grow and expand my knowledge in to new unknown areas. 
Development is the fun part where the hard work from research starts to form itself and grow in to a product, though this can be a painful time it is also the most rewarding as planing is key and the ability to take on opinions and re-approach ideas is very important for growth and the products integrity. 

##### Artistic and Aesthetic background 
As both a designer and trained artist I have a foot in both doors of artistry and construction. I understand portion, scale and colours from passion and foundation in Art. This is mirrored with a love of R&D, planning and construction. With an empathy for users I am able to build easy to use UI systems that also appeal visually.
<!--  From the mixed background and insatiable curiosity I have a great ability to generate ideas and -->
